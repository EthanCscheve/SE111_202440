                <h4>STORY Well the story is fairly obvious, guy gets bitten by spider....guy becomes Spider-Man. It has been seen. However, its the other subplots and character developments which make this film actually (in my opinion) better than the 2002 film. I felt more attached to the characters like Uncle Ben for example. I won't go into details as I don't give spoilers but it was more emotional, and characters were much more relatable. The only real flaws I thought were the villain who's scenes felt a little rushed and the film didn't dwell on his character enough, and also the fact that Peter just wasn't nerdy enough, although that may be down to casting.</h4>

                <h3><b><u>Ethan Scheve</u></b> August 2024</h3>
                <h4>The story and visuals of this movie are great for just a base Spider-man movie. There is great action a good intro to who Peter Parker is, also romance and a villian that can be related to and also despised at the same time. Its overall just a good and fun watch as a huge Spider-man fan, its one of my favorites to go back to and just watch because its good. At the end of the day its either your gonna like this movie if you like super hero type movies, theres a shot you could like it if you arnt though because it caters to not just the already existing fan base.</h4>
