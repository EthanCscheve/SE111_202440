                <h4>STORY Well the story is fairly obvious, guy gets bitten by spider....guy becomes Spider-Man. It has been seen. However, its the other subplots and character developments which make this film actually (in my opinion) better than the 2002 film. I felt more attached to the characters like Uncle Ben for example. I won't go into details as I don't give spoilers but it was more emotional, and characters were much more relatable. The only real flaws I thought were the villain who's scenes felt a little rushed and the film didn't dwell on his character enough, and also the fact that Peter just wasn't nerdy enough, although that may be down to casting.</h4>
